# Lifted NMPC with the Inverted Pendulum on a Cart Example

This repository contains the simulation code accompanying the paper **"Enhanced Sampled-Data Model Predictive Control via Nonlinear Lifting."**  
The full article has been submitted to *IJRNC 2025* and is currently under revision. A preprint is available [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05815).

## Requirements

Before running the simulation, make sure the following are installed:

- **Rust** (required by OpEn for solver compilation)
- **[OpEn (Optimization Engine)](https://alphaville.github.io/optimization-engine/)**

Please follow the installation instructions in the [official OpEn documentation](https://alphaville.github.io/optimization-engine/docs/installation).
